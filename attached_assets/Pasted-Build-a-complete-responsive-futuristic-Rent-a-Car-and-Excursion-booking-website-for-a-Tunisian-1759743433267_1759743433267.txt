Build a complete, responsive, **futuristic Rent-a-Car and Excursion booking website** for a Tunisian agency located in **Hammamet**, operating across all of **Tunisia**.  
Use **React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion + React Router**.  
Design should feel **futuristic yet clean and minimal**, with a **white + blue** color palette inspired by technology and the sea (Hammamet vibe).
